# comMEnd

_Commend yourself the easy way!_

comMEnd is a new tool that lets you commend yourself. [This could be you!](https://imgur.com/0B3XOJX.png)

## How can I install it?

comMEnd ships as a browser extension for either Firefox or Chrome.

### Firefox

1. Download the `b4b838c02a96437597d5-0.1.3.xpi` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/esfalsa/comMEnd/releases/latest). You may be prompted to directly install the add-on.
2. If not, open your add-ons page at about:addons.
3. In about:addons, click the gear icon and select "Install Add-on From Fileâ€¦".
4. comMEnd will need your permission to run. When you visit your nation's page on NationStates, you should receive a prompt in your extensions menu to run comMEnd. You can also click the gear icon and choose to always allow comMEnd to run on nationstates.net sites.

### Chrome

1. Download the `commend-0.1.3.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/esfalsa/comMEnd/releases/latest).
2. Open or extract the file. You should get a folder called `commend-0.1.3`.
3. Open your extensions page at chrome://extensions.
4. Enable developer mode in the top-right corner.
5. Drag and drop the `commend-0.1.3` folder onto your extensions page. Make sure you don't delete the folder in the future.

## How does it work?

comMEnd automatically creates a new self-commendation for the currently logged-in nation. To view your shiny new badge, simply visit your nation's page.

You may notice that your new self-commendation is not visible to other users and is only visible when you are logged in with the extension safely installed. This is because comMEnd comes with a **state-of-the-art cloaking system** that hides your self-commendation from other users, including NationStates administrators and moderators, so you can enjoy your hard-earned commendation in peace. Powered by this system, comMEnd is the **most secure self-commendation tool** on the market and is **near-impossible to detect** for anyone but you. But rest assured, your commendation is still there, and you can see it whenever you want.

comMEnd is powered by **cutting-edge technologies** like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Those are some of the same technologies as used by **leading industry giants** like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, as well as by some of the most innovative and disruptive leaders in the world. For example, these same technologies help power leading **blockchain and cryptocurrency** companies like FTX as well as leading **artificial intelligence** companies like OpenAI.

## Does it really work?
